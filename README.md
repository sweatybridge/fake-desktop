============

A website that's designed to look like a Windows XP desktop environment.

Brief History
=====

I used to love using iframes for webpage layout because it allowed me to conveniently build individual components of my website in a modular fashion before putting them together in a frameset. This website was created back in 2005 to mimic the look and feel of a Windows XP desktop. Simple interactions like the start menu are created by swapping different images in and out. Clicking on My Computer opens up a new page that looks like a file browser.
