      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Another early mechanical computer was the 
        Difference Engine, designed in the early 1820s by British mathematician 
        and scientist Charles Babbage. Although never completed by Babbage, the 
        Difference Engine was intended to be a machine with a 20-decimal capacity 
        that could solve mathematical problems. Babbage also made plans for another 
        machine, the Analytical Engine, considered the mechanical precursor of 
        the modern computer. The Analytical Engine was designed to perform all 
        arithmetic operations efficiently; however, Babbage¡¯s lack of political 
        skills kept him from obtaining the approval and funds to build it. </strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Augusta Ada Byron, countess of Lovelace, 
        was a personal friend and student of Babbage. She was the daughter of 
        the famous poet Lord Byron and one of only a few woman mathematicians 
        of her time. She prepared extensive notes concerning Babbage¡¯s ideas and 
        the Analytical Engine. Lovelace¡¯s conceptual programs for the machine 
        led to the naming of a programming language (Ada) in her honor. Although 
        the Analytical Engine was never built, its key concepts, such as the capacity 
        to store instructions, the use of punched cards as a primitive memory, 
        and the ability to print, can be found in many modern computers.</font></strong></p>
