    <td bgcolor="#0099FF"><p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>In 1965 semiconductor 
        pioneer Gordon Moore predicted that the number of transistors contained 
        on a computer chip would double every year. This is now known as Moore¨s 
        Law, and it has proven to be somewhat accurate. The number of transistors 
        and the computational speed of microprocessors currently doubles approximately 
        every 18 months. Components continue to shrink in size and are becoming 
        faster, cheaper, and more versatile.</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">With their increasing power and versatility, 
        computers simplify day-to-day life. Unfortunately, as computer use becomes 
        more widespread, so do the opportunities for misuse. Computer hackers！people 
        who illegally gain access to computer systems！often violate privacy and 
        can tamper with or destroy records. Programs called viruses or worms can 
        replicate and spread from computer to computer, erasing information or 
        causing malfunctions. Other individuals have used computers to electronically 
        embezzle funds and alter credit histories (see Computer Security). New 
        ethical issues also have arisen, such as how to regulate material on the 
        Internet and the World Wide Web. Long-standing issues, such as privacy 
        and freedom of expression, are being reexamined in light of the digital 
        revolution. Individuals, companies, and governments are working to solve 
        these problems through informed conversation, compromise, better computer 
        security, and regulatory legislation.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Computers will become more advanced and 
        they will also become easier to use. Improved speech recognition will 
        make the operation of a computer easier. Virtual reality, the technology 
        of interacting with a computer using all of the human senses, will also 
        contribute to better human and computer interfaces. Standards for virtual-reality 
        program languages！for example, Virtual Reality Modeling language (VRML)！are 
        currently in use or are being developed for the World Wide Web.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Other, exotic models of computation are 
        being developed, including biological computing that uses living organisms, 
        molecular computing that uses molecules with particular properties, and 
        computing that uses deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), the basic unit of heredity, 
        to store data and carry out operations. These are examples of possible 
        future computational platforms that, so far, are limited in abilities 
        or are strictly theoretical. Scientists investigate them because of the 
        physical limitations of miniaturizing circuits embedded in silicon. There 
        are also limitations related to heat generated by even the tiniest of 
        transistors.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Intriguing breakthroughs occurred in the 
        area of quantum computing in the late 1990s. Quantum computers under development 
        use components of a chloroform molecule (a combination of chlorine and 
        hydrogen atoms) and a variation of a medical procedure called magnetic 
        resonance imaging (MRI) to compute at a molecular level. Scientists use 
        a branch of physics called quantum mechanics, which describes the behavior 
        of subatomic particles (particles that make up atoms), as the basis for 
        quantum computing. Quantum computers may one day be thousands to millions 
        of times faster than current computers, because they take advantage of 
        the laws that govern the behavior of subatomic particles. These laws allow 
        quantum computers to examine all possible answers to a query simultaneously. 
        Future uses of quantum computers could include code breaking (see cryptography) 
        and large database queries. Theorists of chemistry, computer science, 
        mathematics, and physics are now working to determine the possibilities 
        and limitations of quantum computing.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Communications between computer users and 
        networks will benefit from new technologies such as broadband communication 
        systems that can carry significantly more data faster or more conveniently 
        to and from the vast interconnected databases that continue to grow in 
        number and type. </font></strong></p>
