      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>In the early 19th century French inventor 
        Joseph-Marie Jacquard devised a specialized type of computer: a silk loom. 
        Jacquard¡¯s loom used punched cards to program patterns that helped the 
        loom create woven fabrics. Although Jacquard was rewarded and admired 
        by French emperor Napoleon I for his work, he fled for his life from the 
        city of Lyon pursued by weavers who feared their jobs were in jeopardy 
        due to Jacquard¡¯s invention. The loom prevailed, however: When Jacquard 
        died, more than 30,000 of his looms existed in Lyon. The looms are still 
        used today, especially in the manufacture of fine furniture fabrics.<br>
