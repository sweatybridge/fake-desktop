      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Herman Hollerith, an American inventor, 
        used an idea similar to Jacquard¡¯s loom when he combined the use of punched 
        cards with devices that created and electronically read the cards. Hollerith¡¯s 
        tabulator was used for the 1890 U.S. census, and it made the computational 
        time three to four times shorter than the time previously needed for hand 
        counts. Hollerith¡¯s Tabulating Machine Company eventually merged with 
        two companies to form the Computing-Tabulating-Recording Company. In 1924 
        the company changed its name to International Business Machines (IBM).</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">In 1936 British mathematician Alan Turing 
        proposed the idea of a machine that could process equations without human 
        direction. The machine (now known as a Turing machine) resembled an automatic 
        typewriter that used symbols for math and logic instead of letters. Turing 
        intended the device to be a ¡°universal machine¡± that could be used to 
        duplicate or represent the function of any other existing machine. Turing¡¯s 
        machine was the theoretical precursor to the modern digital computer. 
        The Turing machine model is still used by modern computational theorists.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">In the 1930s American mathematician Howard 
        Aiken developed the Mark I calculating machine, which was built by IBM. 
        This electronic calculating machine used relays and electromagnetic components 
        to replace mechanical components. In later machines, Aiken used vacuum 
        tubes and solid state transistors (tiny electrical switches) to manipulate 
        the binary numbers. Aiken also introduced computers to universities by 
        establishing the first computer science program at Harvard University 
        in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Aiken obsessively mistrusted the concept 
        of storing a program within the computer, insisting that the integrity 
        of the machine could be maintained only through a strict separation of 
        program instructions from data. His computer had to read instructions 
        from punched cards, which could be stored away from the computer. He also 
        urged the National Bureau of Standards not to support the development 
        of computers, insisting that there would never be a need for more than 
        five or six of them nationwide.</font></strong><br>
