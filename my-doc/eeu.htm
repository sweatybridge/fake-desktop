      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>At the Institute for Advanced Study in 
        Princeton, New Jersey, Hungarian-American mathematician John von Neumann 
        developed one of the first computers used to solve problems in mathematics, 
        meteorology, economics, and hydrodynamics. Von Neumann's 1945 design for 
        the Electronic Discrete Variable Automatic Computer (EDVAC)¡ªin stark contrast 
        to the designs of Aiken, his contemporary¡ªwas the first electronic computer 
        design to incorporate a program stored entirely within its memory. This 
        machine led to several others, some with clever names like ILLIAC, JOHNNIAC, 
        and MANIAC.</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">American physicist John Mauchly proposed 
        the electronic digital computer called ENIAC, the Electronic Numerical 
        Integrator And Computer. He helped build it along with American engineer 
        John Presper Eckert, Jr., at the Moore School of Engineering at the University 
        of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ENIAC was operational in 1945 and introduced 
        to the public in 1946. It is regarded as the first successful, general 
        digital computer. It occupied 167 sq m (1,800 sq ft), weighed more than 
        27,000 kg (60,000 lb), and contained more than 18,000 vacuum tubes. Roughly 
        2,000 of the computer¡¯s vacuum tubes were replaced each month by a team 
        of six technicians. Many of ENIAC¡¯s first tasks were for military purposes, 
        such as calculating ballistic firing tables and designing atomic weapons. 
        Since ENIAC was initially not a stored program machine, it had to be reprogrammed 
        for each task.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Eckert and Mauchly eventually formed their 
        own company, which was then bought by the Rand Corporation. They produced 
        the Universal Automatic Computer (UNIVAC), which was used for a broader 
        variety of commercial applications. The first UNIVAC was delivered to 
        the United States Census Bureau in 1951. By 1957, there were 46 UNIVACs 
        in use.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Between 1937 and 1939, while teaching at 
        Iowa State College, American physicist John Vincent Atanasoff built a 
        prototype computing device called the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, or ABC, 
        with the help of his assistant, Clifford Berry. Atanasoff developed the 
        concepts that were later used in the design of the ENIAC. Atanasoff¡¯s 
        device was the first computer to separate data processing from memory, 
        but it is not clear whether a functional version was ever built. Atanasoff 
        did not receive credit for his contributions until 1973, when a lawsuit 
        regarding the patent on ENIAC was settled.</font></strong></p>
