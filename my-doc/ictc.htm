        Circuits Transform Computing (ICTC)</em></strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>In 1948, at Bell Telephone Laboratories, 
        American physicists Walter Houser Brattain, John Bardeen, and William 
        Bradford Shockley developed the transistor, a device that can act as an 
        electric switch. The transistor had a tremendous impact on computer design, 
        replacing costly, energy-inefficient, and unreliable vacuum tubes.</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">In the late 1960s integrated circuits (tiny 
        transistors and other electrical components arranged on a single chip 
        of silicon) replaced individual transistors in computers. Integrated circuits 
        resulted from the simultaneous, independent work of Jack Kilby at Texas 
        Instruments and Robert Noyce of the Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation 
        in the late 1950s. As integrated circuits became miniaturized, more components 
        could be designed into a single computer circuit. In the 1970s refinements 
        in integrated circuit technology led to the development of the modern 
        microprocessor, integrated circuits that contained thousands of transistors. 
        Modern microprocessors can contain more than 40 million transistors.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Manufacturers used integrated circuit technology 
        to build smaller and cheaper computers. The first of these so-called personal 
        computers (PCs)¡ªthe Altair 8800¡ªappeared in 1975, sold by Micro Instrumentation 
        Telemetry Systems (MITS). The Altair used an 8-bit Intel 8080 microprocessor, 
        had 256 bytes of RAM, received input through switches on the front panel, 
        and displayed output on rows of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Refinements 
        in the PC continued with the inclusion of video displays, better storage 
        devices, and CPUs with more computational abilities. Graphical user interfaces 
        were first designed by the Xerox Corporation, then later used successfully 
        by Apple Computer, Inc.. Today the development of sophisticated operating 
        systems such as Windows, the Mac OS, and Linux enables computer users 
        to run programs and manipulate data in ways that were unimaginable in 
        the mid-20th century.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Several researchers claim the ¡°record¡± 
        for the largest single calculation ever performed. One large single calculation 
        was accomplished by physicists at IBM in 1995. They solved one million 
        trillion mathematical subproblems by continuously running 448 computers 
        for two years. Their analysis demonstrated the existence of a previously 
        hypothetical subatomic particle called a glueball. Japan, Italy, and the 
        United States are collaborating to develop new supercomputers that will 
        run these types of calculations 100 times faster.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">In 1996 IBM challenged Garry Kasparov, 
        the reigning world chess champion, to a chess match with a supercomputer 
        called Deep Blue. The computer had the ability to compute more than 100 
        million chess positions per second. In a 1997 rematch Deep Blue defeated 
        Kasparov, becoming the first computer to win a match against a reigning 
        world chess champion with regulation time controls. Many experts predict 
        these types of parallel processing machines will soon surpass human chess 
        playing ability, and some speculate that massive calculating power will 
        one day replace intelligence. Deep Blue serves as a prototype for future 
        computers that will be required to solve complex problems. At issue, however, 
        is whether a computer can be developed with the ability to learn to solve 
        problems on its own, rather than one programmed to solve a specific set 
        of tasks.</font></strong><br>
