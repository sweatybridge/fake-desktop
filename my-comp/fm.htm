        naval officer and mathematician Grace Murray Hopper helped develop the 
        first commercially available high-level software language, FLOW-MATIC, 
        in 1957. Hopper is credited for inventing the term bug, which indicates 
        a computer malfunction; in 1945 she discovered a hardware failure in the 
        Mark II computer caused by a moth trapped between its mechanical relays. 
        She documented the event in her laboratory notebook, and the term eventually 
        came to represent any computer error, including one based strictly on 
        incorrect instructions in software. Hopper taped the moth into her notebook 
        and wrote, ¡°First actual case of a bug being found.¡±</strong></font></p></td>
