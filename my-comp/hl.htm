      <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>High-level 
        languages were developed because of the difficulty of programming using 
        assembly languages. High-level languages are easier to use than machine 
        and assembly languages because their commands are closer to natural human 
        language. In addition, these languages are not CPU-specific. Instead, 
        they contain general commands that work on different CPUs. For example, 
        a programmer writing in the high-level C++ programming language who wants 
        to display a greeting need include only the following command: </strong></font> 
      </p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">cout &lt;&lt; ¡®Hello, Encarta User!¡¯ &lt;&lt; 
        endl; </font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">This command directs the computer¡¯s CPU 
        to display the greeting, and it will work no matter what type of CPU the 
        computer uses. When this statement is executed, the text that appears 
        between the quotes will be displayed. Although the ¡°cout¡± and ¡°endl¡± parts 
        of the above statement appear cryptic, programmers quickly become accustomed 
        to their meanings. For example, ¡°cout¡± sends the greeting message to the 
        ¡°standard output¡± (usually the computer user¡¯s screen) and ¡°endl¡± is how 
        to tell the computer (when using the C++ language) to go to a new line 
        after it outputs the message. Like assembly-language instructions, high-level 
        languages also must be translated. This is the task of a special program 
        called a compiler. A compiler turns a high-level program into a CPU-specific 
        machine language. For example, a programmer may write a program in a high-level 
        language such as C++ or Java and then prepare it for different machines, 
        such as a Sun Microsystems work station or a personal computer (PC), using 
        compilers designed for those machines. This simplifies the programmer¡¯s 
        task and makes the software more portable to different users and machines.</font></strong><br>
