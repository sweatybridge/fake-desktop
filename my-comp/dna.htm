      <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Computers 
        can be either digital or analog. Virtually all modern computers are digital. 
        Digital refers to the processes in computers that manipulate binary numbers 
        (0s or 1s), which represent switches that are turned on or off by electrical 
        current. A bit can have the value 0 or the value 1, but nothing in between 
        0 and 1. Analog refers to circuits or numerical values that have a continuous 
        range. Both 0 and 1 can be represented by analog computers, but so can 
        0.5, 1.5, or a number like p (approximately 3.14). </strong></font> </p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">A desk lamp can serve as an example of 
        the difference between analog and digital. If the lamp has a simple on/off 
        switch, then the lamp system is digital, because the lamp either produces 
        light at a given moment or it does not. If a dimmer replaces the on/off 
        switch, then the lamp is analog, because the amount of light can vary 
        continuously from on to off and all intensities in between.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Analog computer systems were the first 
        type to be produced. A popular analog computer used in the 20th century 
        was the slide rule. To perform calculations with a slide rule, the user 
        slides a narrow, gauged wooden strip inside a rulerlike holder. Because 
        the sliding is continuous and there is no mechanism to stop at any exact 
        values, the slide rule is analog. New interest has been shown recently 
        in analog computers, particularly in areas such as neural networks. These 
        are specialized computer designs that attempt to mimic neurons of the 
        brain. They can be built to respond to continuous electrical signals. 
        Most modern computers, however, are digital machines whose components 
        have a finite number of states¡ªfor example, the 0 or 1, or on or off bits. 
        These bits can be combined to denote information such as numbers, letters, 
        graphics, sound, and program instructions.</font></strong></p>
