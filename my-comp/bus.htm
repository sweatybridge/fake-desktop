      <p><font size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The bus enables the 
        components in a computer, such as the CPU and the memory circuits, to 
        communicate as program instructions are being carried out. The bus is 
        usually a flat cable with numerous parallel wires. Each wire can carry 
        one bit, so the bus can transmit many bits along the cable at the same 
        time. For example, a 16-bit bus, with 16 parallel wires, allows the simultaneous 
        transmission of 16 bits (2 bytes) of information from one component to 
        another. Early computer designs utilized a single or very few buses. Modern 
        designs typically use many buses, some of them specialized to carry particular 
        forms of data, such as graphics.</font></p></td>
