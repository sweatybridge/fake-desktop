        physical computer and its components are known as hardware. Computer hardware 
        includes the memory that stores data and program instructions; the central 
        processing unit (CPU) that carries out program instructions; the input 
        devices, such as a keyboard or mouse, that allow the user to communicate 
        with the computer; the output devices, such as printers and video display 
        monitors, that enable the computer to present information to the user; 
        and buses (hardware lines or wires) that connect these and other computer 
        components. The programs that run the computer are called software. Software 
        generally is designed to perform a particular type of task¡ªfor example, 
        to control the arm of a robot to weld a car¡¯s body, to write a letter, 
        to display and modify a photograph, or to direct the general operation 
        of the computer.</strong></font></p></td>
