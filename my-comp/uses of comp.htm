      <strong>People use computers in many ways. In business, computers track 
      inventories with bar codes and scanners, check the credit status of customers, 
      and transfer funds electronically. In homes, tiny computers embedded in 
      the electronic circuitry of most appliances control the indoor temperature, 
      operate home security systems, tell the time, and turn videocassette recorders 
      (VCRs) on and off. Computers in automobiles regulate the flow of fuel, thereby 
      increasing gas mileage. Computers also entertain, creating digitized sound 
      on stereo systems or computer-animated features from a digitally encoded 
      laser disc. Computer programs, or applications, exist to aid every level 
      of education, from programs that teach simple addition or sentence construction 
      to programs that teach advanced calculus. Educators use computers to track 
      grades and communicate with students; with computer-controlled projection 
      units, they can add graphics, sound, and animation to their communications 
      (see Computer-Aided Instruction). Computers are used extensively in scientific 
      research to solve mathematical problems, investigate complicated data, or 
      model systems that are too costly or impractical to build, such as testing 
      the air flow around the next generation of aircraft. The military employs 
      computers in sophisticated communications to encode and unscramble messages, 
      and to keep track of personnel and supplies. </strong></font></td>
