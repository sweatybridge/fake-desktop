      <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Assembly 
        language uses easy-to-remember commands that are more understandable to 
        programmers than machine-language commands. Each machine language instruction 
        has an equivalent command in assembly language. For example, in one Intel 
        assembly language, the statement ¡°MOV A, B¡± instructs the computer to 
        copy data from location A to location B. The same instruction in machine 
        code is a string of 16 0s and 1s. Once an assembly-language program is 
        written, it is converted to a machine-language program by another program 
        called an assembler. </strong></font> </p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Assembly language is fast and powerful 
        because of its correspondence with machine language. It is still difficult 
        to use, however, because assembly-language instructions are a series of 
        abstract codes and each instruction carries out a relatively simple task. 
        In addition, different CPUs use different machine languages and therefore 
        require different programs and different assembly languages. Assembly 
        language is sometimes inserted into a high-level language program to carry 
        out specific hardware tasks or to speed up parts of the high-level program 
        that are executed frequently.</font></strong><font color="#FFFF00"><br>
