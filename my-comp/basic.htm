      <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Hungarian-American 
        mathematician John Kemeny and American mathematician Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth 
        College in Hanover, New Hampshire, developed BASIC (Beginner¡¯s All-purpose 
        Symbolic Instruction Code) in 1964. The language was easier to learn than 
        its predecessors and became popular due to its friendly, interactive nature 
        and its inclusion on early personal computers. Unlike languages that require 
        all their instructions to be translated into machine code first, BASIC 
        is turned into machine language line by line as the program runs. BASIC 
        commands typify high-level languages because of their simplicity and their 
        closeness to natural human language. For example, a program that divides 
        a number in half can be written as,</strong></font> </p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">10 INPUT ¡°ENTER A NUMBER,¡± X <br>
        20 Y=X/2 <br>
        30 PRINT ¡°HALF OF THAT NUMBER IS,¡± Y</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">The numbers that precede each line are 
        chosen by the programmer to indicate the sequence of the commands. The 
        first line prints ¡°ENTER A NUMBER¡± on the computer screen followed by 
        a question mark to prompt the user to type in the number labeled ¡°X.¡± 
        In the next line, that number is divided by two and stored as ¡°Y.¡± In 
        the third line, the result of the operation is displayed on the computer 
        screen. Even though BASIC is rarely used today, this simple program demonstrates 
        how data are stored and manipulated in most high-level programming languages.</font><br>
