        programs that can be run by a computer¡¯s operating system are called 
        executables. An executable program is a sequence of extremely simple instructions 
        known as machine code. These instructions are specific to the individual 
        computer¡¯s CPU and associated hardware; for example, Intel Pentium and 
        Power PC microprocessor chips each have different machine languages and 
        require different sets of codes to perform the same task. Machine code 
        instructions are few in number (roughly 20 to 200, depending on the computer 
        and the CPU). Typical instructions are for copying data from a memory 
        location or for adding the contents of two memory locations (usually registers 
        in the CPU). Complex tasks require a sequence of these simple instructions. 
        Machine code instructions are binary¡ªthat is, sequences of bits (0s and 
        1s). Because these sequences are long strings of 0s and 1s and are usually 
        not easy to understand, computer instructions usually are not written 
        in machine code. Instead, computer programmers write code in languages 
        known as an assembly language or a high-level language.</strong></font></p></td>
