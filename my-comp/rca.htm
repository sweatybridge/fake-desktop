<p><font color="#FF6600" size="4"><strong><em>Range of Computer Ability</em></strong></font></p>
      <p><font color="#FFFF00"><strong>Computers exist in a wide range of sizes 
        and power. The smallest are embedded within the circuitry of appliances, 
        such as televisions and wristwatches. These computers are typically preprogrammed 
        for a specific task, such as tuning to a particular television frequency, 
        delivering doses of medicine, or keeping accurate time. They generally 
        are ¡°hard-wired¡±¡ªthat is, their programs are represented as circuits that 
        cannot be reprogrammed.</strong></font></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Programmable computers vary enormously 
        in their computational power, speed, memory, and physical size. Some small 
        computers can be held in one hand and are called personal digital assistants 
        (PDAs). They are used as notepads, scheduling systems, and address books; 
        if equipped with a cellular phone, they can connect to worldwide computer 
        networks to exchange information regardless of location. Hand-held game 
        devices are also examples of small computers.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Portable laptop and notebook computers 
        and desktop PCs are typically used in businesses and at home to communicate 
        on computer networks, for word processing, to track finances, and for 
        entertainment. They have large amounts of internal memory to store hundreds 
        of programs and documents. They are equipped with a keyboard; a mouse, 
        trackball, or other pointing device; and a video display monitor or liquid 
        crystal display (LCD) to display information. Laptop and notebook computers 
        usually have hardware and software similar to PCs, but they are more compact 
        and have flat, lightweight LCDs instead of television-like video display 
        monitors. Most sources consider the terms ¡°laptop¡± and ¡°notebook¡± synonymous.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Workstations are similar to personal computers 
        but have greater memory and more extensive mathematical abilities, and 
        they are connected to other workstations or personal computers to exchange 
        data. They are typically found in scientific, industrial, and business 
        environments¡ªespecially financial ones, such as stock exchanges¡ªthat require 
        complex and fast computations.</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong><font color="#FFFF00">Mainframe computers have more memory, speed, 
        and capabilities than workstations and are usually shared by multiple 
        users through a series of interconnected computers. They control businesses 
        and industrial facilities and are used for scientific research. The most 
        powerful mainframe computers, called supercomputers, process complex and 
        time-consuming calculations, such as those used to create weather predictions. 
        Large businesses, scientific institutions, and the military use them. 
        Some supercomputers have many sets of CPUs. These computers break a task 
        into small pieces, and each CPU processes a portion of the task to increase 
        overall speed and efficiency. Such computers are called parallel processors. 
        As computers have increased in sophistication, the boundaries between 
        the various types have become less rigid. The performance of various tasks 
        and types of computing have also moved from one type of computer to another. 
        For example, networked PCs can work together on a given task in a version 
        of parallel processing known as distributed computing.</font></strong></p></td>
