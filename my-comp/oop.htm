      <p><font color="#FFFF00" size="3" face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Object-oriented 
        programming (OOP) languages, such as C++ and Java, are based on traditional 
        high-level languages, but they enable a programmer to think in terms of 
        collections of cooperating objects instead of lists of commands. Objects, 
        such as a circle, have properties such as the radius of the circle and 
        the command that draws it on the computer screen. Classes of objects can 
        inherit features from other classes of objects. For example, a class defining 
        squares can inherit features such as right angles from a class defining 
        rectangles. This set of programming classes simplifies the programmer¡¯s 
        task, resulting in more ¡°reusable¡± computer code. Reusable code allows 
        a programmer to use code that has already been designed, written, and 
        tested. This makes the programmer¡¯s task easier, and it results in more 
        reliable and efficient programs.</strong></font></p></td>
