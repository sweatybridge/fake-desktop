        a computer is turned on it searches for instructions in its memory. These 
        instructions tell the computer how to start up. Usually, one of the first 
        sets of these instructions is a special program called the operating system, 
        which is the software that makes the computer work. It prompts the user 
        (or other machines) for input and commands, reports the results of these 
        commands and other operations, stores and manages data, and controls the 
        sequence of the software and hardware actions. When the user requests 
        that a program run, the operating system loads the program in the computer¡¯s 
        memory and runs the program. Popular operating systems, such as Microsoft 
        Windows and the Macintosh system (Mac OS), have graphical user interfaces 
        (GUIs)¡ªthat use tiny pictures, or icons, to represent various files and 
        commands. To access these files or commands, the user clicks the mouse 
        on the icon or presses a combination of keys on the keyboard. Some operating 
        systems allow the user to carry out these tasks via voice, touch, or other 
        input methods.</strong></font></p></td>
