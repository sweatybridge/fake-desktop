        languages contain the series of commands that create software. A CPU has 
        a limited set of instructions known as machine code that it is capable 
        of understanding. The CPU can understand only this language. All other 
        programming languages must be converted to machine code for them to be 
        understood. Computer programmers, however, prefer to use other computer 
        languages that use words or other commands because they are easier to 
        use. These other languages are slower because the language must be translated 
        first so that the computer can understand it. The translation can lead 
        to code that may be less efficient to run than code written directly in 
        the machine¡¯s language.</strong></font></p></td>
