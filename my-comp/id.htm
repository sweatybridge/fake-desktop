        devices, such as a keyboard or mouse, permit the computer user to communicate 
        with the computer. Other input devices include a joystick, a rodlike device 
        often used by people who play computer games; a scanner, which converts 
        images such as photographs into digital images that the computer can manipulate; 
        a touch panel, which senses the placement of a user¡¯s finger and can 
        be used to execute commands or access files; and a microphone, used to 
        input sounds such as the human voice which can activate computer commands 
        in conjunction with voice recognition software. ¡°Tablet¡± computers are 
        being developed that will allow users to interact with their screens using 
        a pen-like device.</strong></font></p></td>
